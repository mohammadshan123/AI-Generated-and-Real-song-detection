# AI-Generated Song vs. Real Song Detection Using Deep Learning

This project aims to classify whether a song's lyrics are AI-generated or written by a human using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model. With the rise of generative AI models, distinguishing between machine-generated and real creative content is becoming increasingly important.

## üìå Project Description

We built a binary classification model to detect whether a given song's lyrics are real (written by a human) or generated by an AI. The project uses natural language processing techniques and an LSTM network to analyze lyrical structure, patterns, and semantics.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset contains two categories:
- **Real Songs**: Lyrics of songs written by humans.
- **AI-Generated Songs**: Lyrics generated using AI models like GPT, T5, etc.

### Dataset Sources:
- Real song lyrics: Publicly available datasets from Kaggle or other sources.
- AI-generated lyrics: Created using pretrained generative models.

The data was preprocessed to clean text, remove noise, and tokenize the lyrics.

## üß† Model: LSTM

The core of the project is an LSTM-based deep learning model built using TensorFlow/Keras. LSTM is well-suited for sequential text data and helps capture temporal dependencies in lyrics.

### Model Architecture:
- Embedding Layer
- LSTM Layer
- Dense Output Layer (Sigmoid activation for binary classification)
